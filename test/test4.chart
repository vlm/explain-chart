/*
 * Define multiple lines.
 */
Parabola = parabola
InvParabola = inverted parabola

/*
 * Say that these lines intersect at a particular point.
 */
Parabola goes through (5, 10) and (7, 10)
Parabola and InvParabola intersect at (10, 15)
InvParabola goes through (5, 10) and (15, 10)

check Parabola coefficients [21.5 ± 1, -4 ± 0.1, 0.33 ± 0.01]
check InvParabola coefficients [-5, 4, -0.2]
