NegCentered = line with steeply negative slope
Neg5x5 = line with steeply negative slope
Neg2points = line with steeply negative slope
Neg2points2 = line with steeply negative slope

Neg5x5 and Neg2points intersect at (5, 5)
Neg2points and none intersect at (0, 15)
Neg2points2 and none intersect at (15, 5)
Neg2points2 and none intersect at (10, 10)

check NegCentered coefficients [67 ± 2, -3.5 ± 0.1]
check Neg5x5 coefficients [24 ± 0.5, -3.7 ± 0.2]
check Neg2points coefficients [15, -2]
check Neg2points2 coefficients [20, -1]
